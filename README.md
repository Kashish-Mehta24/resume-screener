# ðŸ¤– Resume Screening App (BERT-Powered)

This is a Resume Screening System that compares a candidate's resume (in PDF format) with a job description using **BERT embeddings** and **cosine similarity** to compute a match score.

> Built with `sentence-transformers`, `scikit-learn`, `PyMuPDF`, and `Streamlit`.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Upload your resume (PDF)
- Paste a job description
- Get a similarity score between 0 and 1
- See whether your resume is a strong, moderate, or weak match
- Lightweight and runs in the browser with Streamlit

---

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. Extracts text from uploaded PDF resume
2. Uses a pre-trained BERT model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) to create embeddings
3. Calculates cosine similarity between resume and JD
4. Displays score and interpretation
